### Aspects

All projects may be roughly divided into apps and libs.

#### Deployment
Critical to apps. Agnostic to libs.

#### Unsyncs
Cricital to both apps and libs as may lead to broken commits.
(*) â€“ unsyncs between tested and installed dependency version may be
prevented by strict version pinning.

#### Tags versions
Medium importance to both apps and libs.

#### History
Bigger history increases disk and network traffic usage. Probably is more critical to apps
considering their commit number is usually bigger in order(s) of magnitude.
