### Aspects

All projects may be roughly divided into apps and libs.

#### Development
Critical to both apps and libs.

#### Deployment
Critical to apps. Agnostic to libs.

#### Broken commits
Cricital to both apps and libs.
(*) â€“ unsyncs between tested and installed dependency version may be
prevented to some degree by strict version pinning (deps of deps may be [impossible to lock](https://github.com/bower/bower/pull/1592), TODO: describe NPM & Bower current state of this)

#### Tags versions
Medium importance to both apps and libs.

#### History
Bigger history increases disk and network traffic usage. Probably is more critical to apps
considering their commit number is usually bigger in order(s) of magnitude.
